Warning: This code is related to Revision 1 of EBB, not Revision 2. The code would 
have to be adapted for the new file paths that are set by config-pin and the note 
below on $SLOTS is no longer relevant.

An example to use the PWM class on a PWM pin -- See pages 232-233 in the book 
Exploring BeagleBone by Derek Molloy

Before using this example, you MUST load the overlay for the PWM pin that you 
are using. For example, the current code example code assumes that the pin
P9_42 has been exported using the following steps:

root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# sudo sh -c "echo bone_pwm_P9_42 > $SLOTS"
root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# sudo sh -c "echo am33xx_pwm > $SLOTS"
root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $SLOTS
