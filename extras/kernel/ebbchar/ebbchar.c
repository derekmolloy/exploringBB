 * @brief   An introductory character driver to support the second article of my series on
 * Linux loadable kernel module (LKM) development. This module maps to /dev/ebbchar and
 * comes with a helper C program that can be run in Linux user space to communicate with
 * this the LKM.
 * @see http://www.derekmolloy.ie/ for a full description and follow-up descriptions.
